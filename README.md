This is Kima! (＾Ｕ＾)ノ~ＹＯ
I'm a beginner coder. I like both digital and traditional drawing, music making, and learning new stuff.
I’m currently on secod course in college, and here we are studying programming language.
Starting a page in GitHub, on my mind collaborating with my friends and groupmates, which have higher perspectives and ideas of creating... whatever they want.

In case you want to reach me:
  + email: azursevill@gmail.com
  + telegram: @dranik667
  + discord: dranik667#8075

I'd rather have you address to me as they/them, but any kind of pronouns work!

Fun fact: I hate doing graphic design, as my imagination completely blocks out.
